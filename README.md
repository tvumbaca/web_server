Project 2: A Real Web Server and Browser (from the command line)

From The Odin Project: http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/ruby-on-the-web

A simple command line web server that receives requests and sends a response based on those requests, along with a simple browser client to issue those requests.

It basically handles two requests:

  A GET request that serves up a small .html file. (index.html)
  
  A POST request that submits user input which then is used to dynamically modify part of a small template file. (thanks.html)
